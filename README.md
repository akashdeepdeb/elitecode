# (l33tcode/leetcode)
this is some leetcode code I am writing to transition from cpp to python for interviews. 
good chance there are other, more comprehensive repos like this one. 
this is mostly for me to get re-acquainted with coding in python and not use cpp for interviews (seems like a bad idea).
feel free to use this anywhere you please.
